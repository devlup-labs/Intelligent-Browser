  description: >
    Analyze the {{user_request}} and create a structured multi-agent plan using only the allowed agent list.
    Follow the format and reasoning style shown in the example outputs. Do not invent agent names. 
    The output must include a thought process, a task name, agent assignments, and dependency structure. 
    You must also format the `nodes` correctly using input/output/foreach/watch blocks where applicable.
    The output language should follow the language corresponding to the user's task.
    Only use agents from this list: {{agents_list}}

    Refer to the examples from the following list: 
    {{examples_list}}
